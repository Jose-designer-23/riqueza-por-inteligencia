## üõ†Ô∏è Features and Technologies Used

This project was developed with **React**, showcasing advanced handling of its **hooks** for efficient state and effects management.

### React Hooks:

* [**`useState`**](https://es.react.dev/reference/react/useState): Used to manage the state of key components such as the current question, game progress, accumulated money, and wildcard usage.
* [**`useEffect`**](https://es.react.dev/reference/react/useEffect): Used to manage the game's "side effects." This includes playing music and sound effects at specific times, and shuffling the order of questions at the start of each game.
* [**`useRef`**](https://es.react.dev/reference/react/useRef): Used to reference DOM elements, such as audio files, without causing unnecessary re-rendering, which optimizes performance.
* [**`useNavigate`**](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/hooks/use-navigate): Facilitates seamless navigation between the home page and the game screen.
